A website that demostrates my interests, programming projects, contact information, and links my resume. 

It utilizes CSS decoration (particularly flexbox, but also font size/type, coloring) alongside text, images, and links. 

I made this project to practice my CSS (mainly flexbox) and HTML skills as well as to allow people to get to know more about me.
